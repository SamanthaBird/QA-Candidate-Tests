# Test Information

# Background
Law Business Research is a leading provider of business information, legal analysis tools and networking for the global legal markets. With a team of over 360 dedicated professionals around the world, we create high-quality subscription products, intuitive platforms, vital legal analysis tools and must-attend events for our international client base. By combining news and analysis with innovative technology, we help our users to better serve their clients.

One of these subscription products is [Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/).

# Files 
In this repo, you will find an example test file that runs successfully in our automation framework. Our automation framework runs in a Docker container so that it can be easily installed and executed on any machine. In the framework, we use Selenium and Java. For each test, we detail the acceptance criteria in the Gherkin Syntax so that the items under test can be reviewed by non-technical employees at LBR where needed. 

# Tasks

## Task 1 - Manual test
**Time allowed:** 30 minutes

Create as many test cases as possible for the Login page on Lexology: https://www.lexology.com/account/login?returnurl=%2F 
The tests should be written in the Gherkin syntax (GIVEN, WHEN and THEN) and should focus on the elements and functionality of the Login page only. The header and footer elements/functionality are not under test except for the Login button itself. 

## Task 2 - Automation test
**Time allowed:** 1.5 hours

If you have previous automation experience with Java and Selenium, create as many automation scripts as possible for the test cases you created in task 1. You can use the files in this repository as a guideline. Download and update them as required and send over to the email above.
